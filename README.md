I have also mastered using third party api's to draw data from numerous sources and implement the drawn data into my projects as well. I have created full-stack applications and have deployed a few of my projects on Heroku. I am able to create RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. I have set up databases using MySQL and the Sequelize ORM along with MongoDB and the Mongoose ORM and rendered data drawn from my models onto the client side display using handlebars.js and React.js.
