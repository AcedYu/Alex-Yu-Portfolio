# About-Me
Hello, I'm Alex, a Full-Stack Developer. I have recently earned the certificate of completion from the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full-Stack Flex Boot Camp. I have been able to show my competency in completing an assortment of different assignments, each highlighting my proficiency on the programming languages and additional javascript libraries that I can use.

I am highly proficient in the usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also experienced at using the many javascript libaries such as jQuery to strengthen the functionality of my clientside manipulation. I have also mastered using third party api's to draw data from numerous sources and implement the drawn data into my projects as well. I have created full-stack applications and have deployed a few of my projects on Heroku. I am able to create RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. I have set up databases using MySQL and the Sequelize ORM along with MongoDB and the Mongoose ORM and rendered data drawn from my models onto the client side display using handlebars.js and React.js.
